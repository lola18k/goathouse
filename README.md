# Goathouse Bottle Spinner Prompts

This repository contains custom prompts for the bottle spinner game in the "The Goat House" VRChat world, created by lola18k. The prompts are stored in `prompts.txt` and can be loaded into the game via a hosted URL (e.g., using Dropbox, GitHub Gist, or Pastebin as per the asset documentation).

## Description

These prompts are designed for fun, interactive gameplay in VRChat's spin the bottle setup. They include a mix of dares, interactions, and silly actions to keep things engaging in a virtual environment. The file is formatted as a plain text (.txt) with each prompt on a new line.

Example prompts from `prompts.txt`:
- Kiss the player the bottle points to on the cheek.
- Hug the person to your right for 10 seconds.
- Share your most embarrassing VRChat story.
- And more...
